description: Update the active implementation plan with completed tasks and today's date
---
1. **Identify the Active Plan**:
   - Look in `docs/plan/` for the latest implementation plan (e.g., `implement-phase3-development-1.md`).
   - Read the file to see the current status of tasks.

2. **Determine Completed Tasks**:
   - Review the recent conversation history, file changes, or ask the user which tasks have been finished since the last update.

3. **Update the Plan File**:
   - Change the "Completed" column status from empty to ✅ for finished tasks.
   - Update the "Date" column with the current date (YYYY-MM-DD) for those tasks.
   - Update the `last_updated` field in the YAML frontmatter to today's date.
   - **Crucial**: Do not modify tasks that are not yet done.

4. **Verify**:
   - meaningful summary of what was updated.
