description: Create a new implementation plan based on a specification or phase document
---
1. **Identify the Source**:
   - Determine which specification, PRD, or phase document needs to be planned (e.g., `docs/Phase3_Development_Quality_Gates.md`).

2. **Generate the Plan Structure**:
   - Create a new file in `docs/plan/` (e.g., `implement-phaseX-feature.md`).
   - Use the standard frontmatter (goal, version, date_created, etc.).
   - Create sections: Introduction, Requirements, Implementation Steps (Tables), Dependencies, Testing, Risks.

3. **Populate Tasks**:
   - Break down the requirements into atomic file-level tasks.
   - Create a Markdown table with columns: Task, Description, File(s), Function(s), Completed, Date.

4. **Review**:
   - Ensure all tasks are actionable and have clear success criteria.
